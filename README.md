Demo for HTTP-Authoring with a Multilingual REST api

While writing a paper on HTTP-Authoring with a Multilingual REST api, it became time to write some implementation of a server that would be capapble of handling the requests.

Implemented in Dancer2
Note: the Dancer2::Plugin::HTTP::ContentNegotiation is included. The module is still in development and not yet released on CPAN
